<h1>Inheritance</h1>
Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). 
It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.
When defining domain models, we often use Inheritance. However when we try to persist into Relation Database it wont go smooth.
Relational databases don’t support class hierarchies directly, so that's where JPA comes for our rescue and provide below inheritance strategies.
 <h2>Single Table</h2>
 	The Single table inheritance is the default strategy.
 	The Single Table strategy creates one table for each class hierarchy. Since the records for all entities will be in the same table, JPA needs a way to differentiate between each of them. We can use @DiscriminatorColumn annotation in base class to store discriminator value and @DiscriminatorValue can be defined in each subclass.
To customize the discriminator column, we can use the @DiscriminatorColumn annotation:
	This approach makes polymorphic queries very efficient and provides the best performance.
 	<h3>Pros</h3>
 	Single table inheritance mapping is the fastest of all inheritance models, since it never requires a join to retrieve a persistent instance from the database. Similarly, persisting or updating a persistent instance requires only a single INSERT or UPDATE statement. Finally, relations to any class within a single table inheritance hierarchy are just as efficient as relations to a base class.
 	<h3>Cons</h3>
 	The larger the inheritance model gets, the "wider" the mapped table gets, in that for every field in the entire inheritance hierarchy, a column must exist in the mapped table. This may have undesirable consequence on the database size, since a wide or deep inheritance hierarchy will result in tables with many mostly-empty columns.
